# Medical-Appointment-System

Medical appointment management systems are quite important nowadays. It is an efficient way for doctors, especially ones with plenty of patients, to schedule appointments without the hassle of phone calls or in-person appointment management. Some examples of already existing systems of this sort include Doctoralia (this is the brand name in Mexico and Latin America), which allows patients to search for both doctors with a private consultory and those which work at a hospital, as well as, of course, being an auxiliary tool in making appointments. Other examples include TIMIFY, which offers customisable booking options and also supports other kinds of appointment scheduling, and Capterra's DoctorConnect. 

This medical appointment system will allow patients to choose between appointment types, as well as filtering them by doctor. The types which are possible to choose from are Therapy Session, Surgery and General Checkup. It will also allow them to set a time and a date for their appointment.
